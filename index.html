        <div class="subheading mb-5">Pre-Businessüçé</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello! Nice to meet you, currently I am a full time student attending the University of Riverside California. I am majoring in Pre-Business at the moment and would like to go into human resources in the future. I chose Pre-Business as my major because I came into college not really knowing what to become and I wanted to keep my options broad. I really enjoy talking to people and I don‚Äôt think I could handle a career where I would have to sit down alone all day. Which is why I am planning to head into Human resources because then it's a career catered towards interacting with people. A little bit about me is that I am from the Bay Area! Going to Riverside was the first time ever moving away from my parents. I admit it was very difficult at first and I was often homesick, but now I love socal.<br><br>

        I love traveling and coming to UCR and exploring Orange County, Ontario, Los Angeles, and numerous other cities have just made me realize how badly I want to travel in the future. I am also Asian American. I was born and raised in America but my parents are Vietnamese. Currently I am in a student organization called the Vietnamese Student Association also known as UCR VSA. I joined this club to feel more at home since I don‚Äôt have access to a lot of things that remind me of my culture. This club makes me miss home less. The goal I have currently going to UCR is to study abroad. I really want to go to Korea and experience the culture and how advanced technology is over there. The biggest challenge I have faced since attending college would be time management. I have a really hard time declining going out with friends which often leads me to miss sleep and overwork myself on homework. In order to face this problem I recently have been finishing my work before I allow myself to hang out with friends. Its a little hard but it's a lot better than before. 
<br><br>

        Lastly, some of my hobbies are watching shows, listening to music,and video editing.Some of my favorite shows are Japanese cartoons called anime. Some of my favorite anime are Akame Ga kill, Assasination classroom, and Demon slayers. My favorite artist of all time is Luke Chiang. He is an R&b artist and I really recommend listening to him if you enjoy R&b. Video editing is a hobby not many people have. I really enjoy it. I started editing at the age of 14 and at first it started off really bad. I never understood the term practice makes perfect until I began editing. The best thing about editing is seeing your progress overtime. I started off watching youtube videos on how to upload the clips. My friends kind of laughed at me when I began saying my edits were good out of pity. I find it ironic they did that because now they come to me whenever they need help editing a video. It‚Äôs a skill I believe will be useful as technology advances and I‚Äôm glad I have this skill.
